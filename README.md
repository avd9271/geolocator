# geolocator
A basic geolocator program developed as a sample problem for interviewing purposes


---- NOTES ----

the docker piece of this is incomplete. still messing around with it locally. Need to basically create a postgis enabled postgresql instance in the docker image and upload the shapefile to the server.

I'm sure you could upload the whole postgresql server that's on my computer, but I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that's probably not best practices. I'll toy around with it and find out what's best.
